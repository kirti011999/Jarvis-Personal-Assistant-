# Personal Assistant: JARVIS

This Software aims at developing a personal assistant for Windows-based systems. The main purpose of the software is to perform the tasks of the user at certain commands, provided by speech only. It will ease most of the work of the user as a complete task can be done on a single command. Jarvis draws its inspiration from Virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows and Siri for iOS. Users can interact with the assistant through voice commands only.
